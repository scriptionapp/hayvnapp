# A sample medical records app
Welcome to this open source project! It has generated a lot of interest on behalf of medical providers, particularly in rural areas. However, I do not have enough bandwidth to run it on my own.

# Inviting collaborators!
If you are passionate about open source apps, please consider contributing to the project and emailing me suggestions on hayvn.app@gmail.com.

# Technicals

# App overview
In essence, it's a diary app with a folder structure. A doctor can create patients (folders), put together a summary, and create records (stories) for each visit.
Patient's data is shared among all doctors, but it is possible to create more custom access rules using Firebase. The app's logic will change minimally for this.
It has a lot of offline functionality, and the app is focused on security.
